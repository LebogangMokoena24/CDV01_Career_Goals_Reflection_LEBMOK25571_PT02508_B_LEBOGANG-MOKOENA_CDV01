### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

**1.** **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

 **Goal 1: Obtain a position in a bank's IT or technology department within the next 12 months.**

 -Specific: Consider roles that mix finance and IT, such as IT Analyst or Developer.

 -Measurable: Apply for at least 5-10 related positions and get an interview.

 -Achievable: I have a finance background and basic coding abilities; this is attainable with targeted applications and ongoing skill development.

 -Relevant: This is consistent with my interest in fintech and obtaining experience at the interface of finance and technology.

 -Time-bound: Within the next twelve months.

Rationale : Working at a bank's IT department will provide me with real experience at the junction of banking and technology, which is essential for my long-term aim of working for a fintech startup.  It will help me better grasp banking systems, financial software, and IT infrastructure, laying a solid foundation for future fintech positions.
 
 **Goal 2:  Improve your technical coding skills by participating in at least one hackathon during the next year.**

 -Specific: Concentrate on  CSS, Java Script, Python, data analytics, and fintech-related development projects.

 -Measurable: Attend one hackathon and track your progress with code projects or certificates.

 -Achievable: I am actively learning through Codespace and set time aside weekly for practice.

 -Relevant: Increases my ability to contribute to technical financial projects.

 -Timeframe: Within 12 months.

Rationale: Improving my coding abilities in various languages, data analytics, and fintech-related projects would help me become more competent in technical roles and confident in bringing technology to financial solutions.  Participating in a hackathon will push me to use these skills in real-world situations, improve my problem-solving abilities and conquer my fear of failing in front of others.

**2.** **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
-Goal 1: Work in a fintech company as a strategic or technical leader, combining finance skills with technology solutions.

This is consistent with my interests in fintech, innovation, and using technology to make a real financial impact.

By gaining expertise in banking IT and establishing strong technical abilities, I will be prepared to take on more advanced fintech roles.

-Goal 2: Lead projects or initiatives that promote financial accessibility and inclusiveness.

This contributes to my personal objective of living an influential life and resonates with my values of integrity, ubuntu, and collaboration.

I want to use my technical and financial skills to create solutions that increase corporate productivity and make financial services more accessible.
   
I did not apply the SMART method to my long-term goals because people grow and change over time, and my short-term experiences may shape and refine these long-term aspirations. Additionally, long-term goals are influenced by changing opportunities, evolving industries, and personal growth, so being too rigid could limit adaptability and the ability to seize new paths aligned with my interests in finance and technology.

### Part 4: Action Plan

**1.** **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

In order to fulfil my short-term goal of landing a job in a bank's IT or technology division, I will look into internships and apply for interships and  jobs that integrate technology and finance, including those for IT analysts or developers.  I'll revamp my resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect both my finance background and my new coding talents, which include Python, Java, and data analysis.  I plan to network with banking IT experts through LinkedIn, university alumni, and industry events, as well as seek mentorship from individuals working at the interface of finance and technology, to learn practical skills and career assistance.  Preparing for interviews will entail practicing coding problems, technical exams, and financial case studies.Resources that will help me achieve my goal include online coding platforms, university career services, professional networking platforms, and mentorship opportunties.

To enhance my technical coding abilities and participate in at least one hackathon, I plan to spend a consistent amount of time each week learning Python, Java, APIs, and data analytics through Codespace exercises and online classes.  I will look for upcoming hackathons or coding competitions and register to join, working with peers to practise problem solving, teamwork, and technical communication.  I will also document and reflect on the problems encountered during these exercises and hackathons in order to develop resilience, confidence, and the ability to deal with failure constructively.  This goal's resources include Codespace, online tutorials, hackathon platforms, and peer support networks.

**2.** **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:

To prepare for a strategic or technical job at a fintech company, I will acquire hands-on experience in banking IT and develop knowledge of real-world financial systems and digital operations.  I plan to create a portfolio of coding projects that demonstrate how to apply technology to financial challenges using Python and Java.  Staying up to date on fintech developments through webinars, workshops, conferences, and industry publications, as well as networking with industry professionals, will be critical for learning about developing skills and opportunities.  To increase credibility, additional preparation could include acquiring certifications in data analytics, Python, Java, or financial technology platforms.

To prepare for leading projects or initiatives that improve financial accessibility and inclusion, I plan to volunteer or collaborate on projects that use technology to empower people financially.  I plan to continue honing my leadership, project management, and communication abilities through academic projects, internships, and Codespace. Monitoring breakthrough financial solutions and studying how to implement them in real-world situations will help me match my talents with industry-relevant prospects.  Mentorship, professional networks, industry publications, and hands-on project experience are all valuable resources and assistance for long-term readiness.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

**1.** **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
**- Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.**

One of the most difficult hurdles I anticipate in achieving my career goals is overcoming the fear of participating in hackathons and public coding exercises.  I occasionally struggle with the prospect of failing in front of others, which might undermine my confidence while attempting new technical tasks.  Furthermore, mastering coding languages such as Python and Java and using them in real-world financial scenarios necessitates constant practice and devotion, which can be challenging to manage with other duties.  Another major hurdle is getting practical experience in fintech or banking IT, as competitive employment may necessitate networking, strong technical abilities, and previous project experience.  

**- Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.**

To overcome these obstacles, I intend to gradually participate in coding projects and hackathons, beginning with smaller, less-pressured contexts to gain confidence.  I will seek mentoring and peer support to help me learn and provide constructive criticism.  Setting reasonable learning targets and managing my time will allow me to gradually improve my coding and financial technology skills.

**2.** **Opportunities for Growth**:

There are various chances that I can take advantage of to help me advance my profession and overcome obstacles.  I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Java with Codespace, which offers a controlled setting for developing technical abilities and applying them to finance-related projects.  Participating in coding exercises, mini-projects, and eventually hackathons will allow me to gradually tackle my fear of failure in public, gain confidence, and improve my problem-solving skills.  Networking with colleagues and mentors at Codespace, as well as specialists in banking IT and fintech, will provide assistance, feedback and future career prospects.  Furthermore, remaining updated about upcoming fintech trends and implementing the technical skills I learn will allow me to pursue significant positions that integrate my interests in finance and technology.
