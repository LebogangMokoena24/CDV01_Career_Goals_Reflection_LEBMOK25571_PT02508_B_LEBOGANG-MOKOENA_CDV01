It will help me better grasp banking systems, financial software, and IT infrastructure, laying a solid foundation for future fintech positions.
 
 **Goal 2:  Improve your technical coding skills by participating in at least one hackathon during the next year.**

 Specific: Concentrate on  CSS, Java Script, Python, data analytics, and fintech-related development projects.

 Measurable: Attend one hackathon and track your progress with code projects or certificates.

I did not apply the SMART method to my long-term goals because people grow and change over time, and my short-term experiences may shape and refine these long-term aspirations.
